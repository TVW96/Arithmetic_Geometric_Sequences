# Arithmetic & Geometric Sequence Generators

1. function for generating arithmetic sequences given values a1=intial value, d=common difference, n=number of terms.
2. function for generating geometric sequences given values a1=inital value, r=common ratio, n=number of terms.
3. Combined both of these operations to create a fucntion CombinedGenerator(). This function request for use of arithmetic or geeometric operator before running the sequence. After completion it will request a Yes or No for whether or not you are done using the application. If Yes it will run again, if no program will shutdown.
